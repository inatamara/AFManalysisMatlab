# AFManalysisMatlab
This repository contains Matlab script to analyse the AFM data to obtain elastic, and viscoelastic constants.
This scripts were developped for the following publication:
 "Multi-scale study of the architecture, topography and mechanics of the
human ovary from prepuberty to menopause: a blueprint for next-generation bioengineering and diagnosis"
 Ouni et al., currently under review in Nature communication.
The file ForceTimeSpetroscopy_AFMviscoelasticModel.m allows to analyse AFM data aquired on JPK AFM microscope ('.OUT' file extension) to
calculate the viscoelastic response of a tissue from AFM measurements.
It fits double exponential plus linear trend to the data and recovers two viscoelaastic time constants.
The PlotResultsViscoelatic3ageGroups.m permits to plot the results that can be accessed in the following Mendeley data repository:
